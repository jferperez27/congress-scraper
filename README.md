**Congressional Data Parser and Scraper**

This program implements the Selenium WebDriver API to access and parse the HTML files directly from the Congress.gov website.

**Proposed Plan**
  [âœ”] Successfully scrape HTML data from Congress.gov
  [...] Parse specific data needed from HTML files - Using BeautifulSoup
  [...] Test retrieval and parsing methods for consistency
  [...] Incorporate Pandas API to create a DataFrame consisting of parsed data
  [...] Ensure no outliers in DataFrame, clean data as necessary, format data to proper types
  [...] Export Pandas DataFrame Object into an Excel file
